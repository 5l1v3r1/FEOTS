## About
 The Fast Equilibration of Ocean Tracers Software (FEOTS) is a General Circulation Model (GCM) post-processing tool for running offline passive tracer simulations. Offline passive tracer simulations are particularly attractive because they can be run on fewer computational resources than a full-fledged GCM. FEOTS operates in either forward mode or equilibration mode for performing transient simulations or for obtaining equilibrium solutions.  For large biogeochemical tracer systems, FEOTS offers a hybrid MPI-OpenMP parallelization strategy for maintaining reasonable throughput. There are also packages for tagging water masses based on ocean state variables (e.g. potential temperature, salinity, etc.) and location, for studying ocean mixing and water mass pathways.
